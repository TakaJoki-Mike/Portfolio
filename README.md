## Hello there, you can view my portfolio here!

### About Me

My name is Michael, but you can call me Mike. I am a junior QA engineer with experience in APIs and SQL. I often read and watch educational content related to testing.

### Please find below the details of a project I worked on:

**Project 1**  
Name: *Skyeng Web Application Test for Teachers*  
User-story: *The teacher can schedule personal events to serve as reminders for their own meetings.*

**Tasks Assigned:**

1. Test "Personal events"
2. Select the appropriate testing type, justify selection, create & manage test docs. Enter and prioritize test cases in TMS, detect bugs, and generate TMS reports.
3. Demonstrate the skills acquired in the course by applying them in practical situations. 

**Project solution:**  

- After conducting an analysis of the scheduling system, a [decomposition](https://github.com/TakaJoki-Mike/Portfolio/blob/main/Files/Projectscreens/miro.jpg) was created.

- A set of [checklists](https://github.com/TakaJoki-Mike/Portfolio/blob/main/Files/Projectscreens/sitechco.jpg) and [test cases](https://github.com/TakaJoki-Mike/Portfolio/tree/main/Files/Projectscreens/Qase.io) were put together.
- Discovered [errors](https://github.com/TakaJoki-Mike/Portfolio/tree/main/Files/Projectscreens/Bugs).
- The checks have been successfully carried out and their results have been recorded. The document was formatted using the [Confluence](https://github.com/TakaJoki-Mike/Portfolio/blob/main/Files/Projectscreens/work_in_confluence.jpg) application.

**Conclusions:**  
As a result of the project, the following outcomes were achieved:
A [bug related to highlight text](https://github.com/TakaJoki-Mike/Portfolio/tree/main/Files/Projectscreens/Bugs/Conclusion) has been discovered, which causes the form to close with all the entered data. This issue could result in a bad impression of the application for users. It is important to fix this bug before releasing the application to ensure a smooth user experience.

**Project 2**  
Name: *Skyeng Web Application Test for Teachers*  
User-story: *The teacher can schedule personal events to serve as reminders for their own meetings.*

**Tasks Assigned:**

1. Test "Personal events" 
2. Testing an application using the API
3. Demonstrate the skills acquired in the course by applying them in practical situations. 

**Project solution:**  

- [Postman](https://github.com/TakaJoki-Mike/Portfolio/blob/main/Files/API/API%20coure%20work.postman_collection%20(1).json) was used to perform API testing.  Portfolio/Files/API/postman.png
