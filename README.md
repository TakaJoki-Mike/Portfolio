### About Me

My name is Michael, but you can call me Mike. I am a junior QA engineer with experience in APIs and SQL. I often read and watch educational content related to testing.

### Please find below the details of a project I worked on:

**Project Name:** Skyeng Web Application Test for Teachers  
**Tasks Assigned:**
1. Test "Personal events"
2. Demonstrate the skills acquired in the course by applying them in practical situations. 
3. Select the appropriate testing type, justify selection, create & manage test docs. Enter and prioritize test cases in TMS, detect bugs, and generate TMS reports.

**Project solution:**  
User-story - The teacher can schedule personal events to serve as reminders for their own meetings.
After conducting an analysis of the scheduling system, a decomposition was created.
**Conclusions:**  
As a result of the project, the following outcomes were achieved:
1. Result No. 1
2. Result No. 2
